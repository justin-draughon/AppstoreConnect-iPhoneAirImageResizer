# AppstoreConnect-iPhoneAirImageResizer
This script takes the iPhone Air screenshots from the simulator and converts them slightly into the dimensions Apple requires for Appstore Connect. 

To Run: Copy the script into the directory with your screenshots. Open a terminal in that folder and run "python image_resizer.py" 

The script will take all images in the folder and resize them to 1284 x 2778, which is the dimensions Apple requires. The output files will be placed in the same folder, but with "RESIZE - " appended to the beginning of the file name.
